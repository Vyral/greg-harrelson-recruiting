Are you tired of brokers asking you what you’re going to do to grow your business, or bring more listings into the company, or write more contracts?

Oftentimes, brokers ask these types of questions not to help you, but to know how you can help them earn their income. In other words, a broker’s income is really nothing more than a commission they earn for the services they provide to you, while your income is the commission you earn from the services you provide to buyers and sellers.

**What is your broker doing to earn the money you’re making for them, though?** That’s an interesting conversation, and I’m by no means trying to start a feud between you and the company you work for, but I do think that both parties have a responsibility to provide the resources and strategies necessary for each other to grow.

Now that the new year has arrived, perhaps it’s time for you to ask yourself whether you’re getting the services and resources you need from the company you’re with. **There are three common complaints I hear from agents in search of a better business model:**

**1. There are no leads**. Either that or the leads they’re provided are very low quality and given mostly in order to appease them.

**2. There’s no coaching or training**. A lot of top-level professionals in all industries have a coach. Coaching can provide additional strategies you may not have thought of, the resources needed to execute those strategies, accountability, and answers to problems that are keeping your business from growing. Some companies insist that their agents hire their own coaches, but that just means they’ll have to pay another person a portion of their commission for their services, whereas I believe that should be the company’s responsibility.

**3. There is too much paperwork**. Again, I believe that processing listing paperwork is the company’s responsibility. I also believe that they should handle some of the marketing for those listings.

If you don’t think you’re getting the value you need from your company, should you just quit? No—I’m not saying that at all. All I’m trying to do is open your eyes to the value you deserve, and **sometimes getting that value is as simple as having a conversation with your broker about what you need from them**. Give them a chance to provide you with the services and resources you need. If they can’t provide these things, it’s up to you whether you want to make a move or not.

With technology so readily available to us, I believe your company should provide you with the CRMs, strategies, and other data you need to generate listings and buyer opportunities. Companies should also provide nurture programs that will allow you to convert data into commission checks.

**In addition to teaching you how to generate leads, companies should also provide leads themselves**. Most agents will never make a good living if they rely specifically on either self-generated leads or company-generated leads, but if you combine these two things, you’ll find yourself at the top of your business.

Again, I’m not trying to cause any problems between you and your company, but the next time you’re thinking about what you’re doing for them, ask yourself what they’re doing for you as well. If you need additional resources, talk to them and see if you can work something out. If you can’t, you might want to explore your other options.

I coach agents in the Myrtle Beach, Charleston, and Columbia areas, so if you’re in any of these marketplaces, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to sit down with you and see if I can help you advance your career.

If you have any other questions for me or there’s anything else I can help you with, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to talking to you.
