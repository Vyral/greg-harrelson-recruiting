&nbsp;

Have you ever wondered what it would take for you to start your new year ahead of your goals? Today **I have three things you can do to generate momentum quickly and get ahead of your goals to make 2019 your best year yet:**

**1. Call your centers of influence**. Everybody says this, but I want to add a twist to it. Your intention for calling these people at the beginning of the year is to identify who may be thinking about completing a real estate transaction sometime in the next calendar year. Ask them what their real estate goals are for this year to get a better idea of where their head is. **If you don’t ask that question, it’s going to be hard for you to pull out the information yourself**. You will find business this way, even on the first day you make 10+ phone calls.

**2. Communicate with your database**. Your database is a bit different than your center of influence. It is a larger group, and it’s important to leverage and monetize this group. Calling everyone in your database will result in you reaching out to a good amount of people that you may never have met in person or only met once. **By consistently reaching out to these people throughout the year, you can bring them valuable content and make sure you’re a household name to them**. Once you call these people, you’re going to ask them the same question that you asked your center of influence. Ask them what their real estate goals for 2019 are. This method is free, effective, and will help you generate momentum fast.

**3. Get out of your box**. If you continue to do the same things, you’ll continue to get the same results. If you want to generate momentum fast and get ahead of your goals, I suggest that you get out of your box. One type of box is your lead generation strategy. If you’re only working with buyers, get out of that box and call those past buyers you have to see if any of them are interested in listing. If your box is cold calling, get out of that box by calling FSBOs and expireds.

In other words, add another lead generation pillar to your business so you can find additional lead sources and give yourself a better chance of doing more business. Maybe getting out of your box has to do with your environment. If you feel like you’re not growing and your career has become stagnant, stop making excuses and change that environment. Find a group that will mentor, guide, and develop you in order to build your business. I’m not saying you have to change companies, but if you’re not getting what you need to grow your business, it’s time to make a change by using one of these tips above.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about your 2019 goals or about real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
