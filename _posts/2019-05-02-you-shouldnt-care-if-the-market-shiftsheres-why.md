As a professional agent, should you care if our market shifts?

If you set your business up correctly, the answer is no. If anything, a market shift can help you because it will lead to more part-time agents switching careers and leaving a bigger piece of the pie behind.

We don’t want anybody to suffer because of a downturn, but for some, this is inevitable. If you want to keep your business stable in the face of a market shift, there are three tips you need to follow that will help you focus on helping your clients instead of just surviving.

**For your convenience, I’ve timestamped each of these tips and how you can apply them so you can skip ahead in the video above at your leisure:**

* 2:00 - Go lean
* 4:03 - Collaborate
* 5:38 - Be active, not passive

No matter what’s going on in your local market, you need to follow these three tips. Another way to think of them is by breaking them down into this simple formula: fewer expenses + more ideas + more leads = more business no matter what the market does.

We care very much about putting our clients in the best financial position possible during a market shift, but we shouldn’t have to stress out over our business.

If you’d like to talk more about how to thrive instead of merely survive during a market shift, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
