<center><em>In the second part of my four-part series on building a listing-based business, I&rsquo;ll teach you how to master the scripts.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Welcome to the second installment of my four-part series explaining how to build a listing-based business. As you recall, <u><a target="_blank" href="https://agentgrowthstrategies.com/whats-your-path-to-building-a-real-estate-business.html">last time</a></u> we discussed who to call, when to call, and how many people to call.

In today’s video, I’ll talk about the scripts you’ll use for these calls. **Everything we do in this business comes at the end of a conversation**, and scripts are key to mastering the conversation. Therefore, you must master the scripts.&nbsp;

Stay tuned for part three of my series. In the meantime, if you have any questions about this topic or there’s anything else I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
