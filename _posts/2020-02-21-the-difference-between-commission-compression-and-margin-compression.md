<br>What’s the difference between commission compression and margin compression?

Commission compression is when consumers demand a lower commission rate that agents can charge. Margin compression is when the profitability of a transaction goes down.

I’ve seen a lot of studies disproving the notion that the commissions agents can charge are declining in our industry. There are certain commission-cutting agents and companies out there, but remember that there are iBuyers out there charging fees that are higher than a commission in many cases. **What *is* decreasing *is* profitability per transaction**. When this decreases, it doesn’t mean commissions are lower; it means the cost of the transaction is increasing.

What’s impacting our margins like this? Well, a lot of transactions are being done with referral fees and paid leads. Whether you use Zillow, Realtor.com, social media advertising, etc., there’s a cost to generating those leads. That adds a heavy expense to your transaction, so by the time you get your normal commission, the profitability is lower. The same goes if you’re getting referral fees from third-party referral sources.

As agents, **the best thing we can do is continue to provide value so we can charge whatever commission rate we feel we’re worth**. More importantly, we need to look at our bottom line. How can you generate more business at a lower cost? How can you decrease the cost of lead generation? One way is by learning how to generate leads at no cost. That’s what I coach my agents to do every single day.
