&nbsp;

As we delve deeper into my series about building a listing-based business, today I’ll focus on the rituals of top agents and how you can master your own rituals. Unfortunately, many agents are consistent at being inconsistent, and a lack of consistency results in a lack of freedom. How? **Inconsistency in your activities leads to inconsistency in your financials**.

Follow along in the video above to learn how to master your rituals. Also, stay tuned for the final installment of this series. In the meantime, if you have any questions about this topic or there’s anything else I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
