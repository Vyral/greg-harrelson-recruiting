&nbsp;

There are three things you can change in your mindset that will help you get more out of your real estate business.

There are many distractions and frustrations that come at us throughout each day. How we manage these trials is up to our attitude, approach, and expectations.&nbsp;

**Take a look at your attitude**. Do you see the glass as half empty or half full? Are things problems or opportunities? Your attitude affects how you view situations, and if you see things as pains and problems, you’re much less likely to want to deal with them. If you take things as challenges that you can solve, you’ll do much better in your business.

Let’s say you get a low ball offer—it can be discouraging and may put you in a negative mindset. If you think, “This is never going to work out,” how is that going to affect your approach? Think of it this way: You got an offer, which means you’re better off than when you had none. Then, it’s time to figure out how you can negotiate it into something better.

**If you’re feeling discouraged and upset, your approach will reflect that**. That approach further harms your expectations. If you feel like everything is going to fail, and you act like everything is going to fail, then what are you going to expect of the end result? If you don’t expect a positive outcome, it’ll be hard for your client to expect one.

**Your client will mirror your actions**. If you’re positive, they’ll stay positive as well, but if you’re negative, they’ll also follow suit. With a negative outlook, deals that could be salvaged are instead being thrown away. Ultimately, your attitude, approach, and expectations will influence your final results. These results are generated from your clients’ feelings, so it’s up to you whether you want the outcome to be good or bad.

If you want good results, have a great attitude when it’s difficult. **Things will rarely be perfect, but if you can stay positive through the pain, you will win in the end**.
