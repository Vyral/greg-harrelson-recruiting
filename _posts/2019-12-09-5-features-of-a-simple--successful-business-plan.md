<center><em>In order to be even more successful next year, your business plan must contain five key features.</em></center>

<br>Now that we’re approaching the year’s end, many people have begun talking about their business plan for 2020. I believe that the best business plans are kept simple; too many people make elaborate, pages-long business plans that can become confusing. Don’t get me wrong—it’s good to be detailed in your plans, but don’t overcomplicate it to the point of uselessness. Today I’ll discuss five key features of a simple and successful business plan.

**Feel free to follow along in the video above or use the timestamps provided below to navigate the discussion at your leisure:**

1:16 - Review the previous year

2:20 - Add your new goals

3:15 - Write down three things you need to accomplish

4:00 - Know your numbers

5:22 - Design your morning routine

If you take these five steps to heart when forming your business plan for 2020, I genuinely believe that you’ll be in for a more prosperous year.

As a final note: **I’m looking to grow my team**. If you or someone you know would like to level-up in your career and boost your production by joining a team that provides abundant resources and coaching, feel free to reach out to the Harrelson Group. We hope to hear from you soon\!
