Welcome to the fourth and final installment of my series about how to build a listing-based business. Today, I’ll talk about how to understand the listing process. In my decision-making process, I always default to logic (i.e., facts and data). Why? Aside from the obvious, when it comes to real estate transactions, **sellers tend to make their decisions based on logic, while buyers tend to make theirs based on emotion**. When dealing with sellers, opinions are only important when they’re based on facts.

Follow along in the video above to find out what else you need to know to understand the listing process. If you have any questions about this or any of the previous topics I’ve discussed in terms of building a listing-based business, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
