<center><em>I&rsquo;ve got a fun, quick challenge for you to complete this Friday. Here&rsquo;s what you need to do.</em></center>

&nbsp;

I recently had an idea that I decided to turn into a challenge. Usually when I challenge you, it’s to take an action that I know is going to bring a big benefit back to you and your business. It’s also usually something that is simple and free. This challenge is no exception.

**Here’s what I created: The Friday Facebook Challenge**. It’s very simple and will only take about five minutes. I challenge every one of you to follow this system today:

**1\. Take one of your listings or a company listing and post it on your personal Facebook page today**. Posting to your personal page will ensure that the people we want to attract (your sphere) see the post.

**2\. Include “Featured listing by (your name) at (company name)” with a link under that line to the listing**. The branding here is invaluable and will direct traffic to the listing.

**3\. Keep up with the post throughout the day to see if it has been liked, commented on, or shared**. If somebody shares the post with someone specific, you can bet they are looking for a home that fits the criteria. The person who shared it with them tips us off to the lead, who you can then reach out to. We have used this strategy and gotten leads, set appointments, and written contracts.

There you go. Your Friday Facebook Challenge is quick, simple, free, and effective. It can put you in a great position to get a new lead that you can start working tomorrow. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
