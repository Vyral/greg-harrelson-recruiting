&nbsp;

In just the first quarter of 2019, we had 816 listings, but by the time you read this, the Harrelson Group will probably have well over 900 listings under our belt. But how do we do that?

Well first, **I may own our brokerage, but I run it like a team**. Each of our team members is independently building their own business—I just happen to be the coach providing the systems, leads, training, and resources needed to build a business.

At the end of 2018, we began to set goals and make commitments. Our goal was to increase the number of listings taken and improve our inventory levels. So many people were upset about how hard it was to find listings in our low-inventory market.

Next, **we committed to collaboration**. As a group, we brainstormed tactics for increasing the number of listings we would take and created hundreds of ideas on how we could obtain new listings. Each individual agent then decided which of those ideas they wanted to focus on; some focused on just one tactic, and others focused on executing five or 10 different ideas.

At our office, we have a saying: “Your goal is my goal.” We’re constantly setting goals and working together to help our team members actually achieve those goals, and time has shown that when we help out fellow agents do better in their business, we become better ourselves.

In our team-oriented environment, **we also hold each other accountable**. When someone creates a big goal to meet, there will always be times when they don’t feel like showing up or taking action on the commitments they made. But on our team, when one agent sees another slipping up, they’ll reach out and prod them on and ask how they can help get them back on track. A team environment pushes everybody to the top.

Lastly, **we took action to actually execute our goals**. We didn’t just call 5,000 homeowners and get 816 listings—there are so many ways to get listings. Our success is due to our focus on the approach, not on our methods of getting the listings themselves.

Making goals, collaborating, holding each other accountable, and executing strategies are key if you want to grow your listing inventory. The challenge that most people have is being all by themselves. On a team, we put our heads together to help each other figure it out.

**Follow this model of approach and just see what will happen to your business over the next three or four months**. If you have any questions, feel free to give me a call or send an email. I’d love to talk with you about how to create this type of environment in your own brokerage.
