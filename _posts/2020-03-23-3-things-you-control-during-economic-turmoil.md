<br>Truthfully, we don’t know exactly what’s going to happen with the market in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. We do know that there are many agents out there, and if you’re one of them, today I’ll share a little of my advice with you.

**Real estate agents still have control over three things during times of economic turmoil, and if you take control of them properly, it’ll make a world of difference in your business:**

**1\. Attitude**. Is your glass half-empty or half-full? Do you focus on the negatives or the positives? Are you bringing solutions to the conversation or are you shooting them down? If you can find the right, positive outlook and bring that to every business conversation you have, you’ll find that there are always advantageous opportunities.

**2\. Approach**. What’s your plan for communicating with past clients, your sphere of influence, current buyer leads, active seller leads, etc.? Do you tend to plan things out, or do you just wing it? If you have the right attitude and the right approach, you’ll be well ahead of your competition.

**3\. Expectations**. Do you visualize positive outcomes for your listing presentations, price reduction consultations, or calls with your sellers when buyers want to renegotiate? You need to control your expectations and focus on the positive.

Take control over what you can in our current uncertain environment. I know that it’s tough to ignore the distractions, but you need to stay current with the latest developments because you’ll have to be able to communicate with your clients and customers. Keep your focus, keep your cool, and be the calming voice for the consumer.

If there’s anything I can do for you, please reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you and figure out if I can help you grow your business to the next level.
