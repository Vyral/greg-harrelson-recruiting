<center><em>If you&rsquo;re struggling with motivation in your real estate career, I&rsquo;ve got some tips that will hopefully get you back on the right path.</em></center>

<br>I’m hearing a lot from real estate agents out there who are struggling with staying motivated. Maybe something has thrown them off track in the early stages of the year and it’s tough to get their mind back in the game. I wanted to share some helpful information today if you’re in the same situation.

If you're struggling with motivation, you're probably asking yourself a lot of “why” questions. I’m a big believer in identifying your purpose and letting that be the foundation of your motivation. That’s a deep conversation to have with yourself and it takes a long time to really figure out your true purpose.

While you're in that mode of discovering your “why,” **I think these three simple actions will help you get yourself a little more motivated and discover why you’re in this business:**

**1\. Text 10 centers of influence today**. Ask them about their goals for real estate this year. You don’t have to ask them to buy or sell—just ask them about real estate and what their goals are for 2020. This should motivate you to see how many of these people will text you back and engage you in a conversation about real estate. Engagement is the first step to getting results.

**2\. Text 10 past clients**. Say something like this: “Values of properties like you purchased in the past have gone up. Interested in selling yours?” You’re going to get a higher engagement rate on these 10 texts.

**3\. Text three friends or family members**. Just say something simple like, “Hey, I was just thinking about you. I hope today is your best day of the week.” You can come up with better wording than that, but here’s the point: Reach out to people who value you and what you’ve done for them in their lives. You probably won’t get business out of it, and that’s not the goal here, but you will get engagement. Engagement makes you feel good and when you feel good, you’ll be much more motivated.

If I can do anything for you and your business, please let me know. Reach out by phone or email today and I would love to have a conversation with you.
