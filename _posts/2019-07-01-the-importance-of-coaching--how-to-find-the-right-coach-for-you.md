&nbsp;

If you’re looking to build and sustain a profitable business, then you need to hire a coach. I believe all real estate agents (and all professionals in any industry) should hire a coach.

Why? No matter how well you’re doing, you can still do more with less effort, and this is where a coach can help you. You can be making money, but a coach can make you more profitable. Additionally, people only seem to want to hire a coach when they’re not doing so well, but if you wait until business falters to hire a coach, you have to deal with the challenge of actually paying that coach.

Now, with that in mind, here are three tips that will help you hire the right coach.

First, **choose a coach who’s walked the walk**. There are a lot of coaches out there who’re willing to take your money but haven’t actually done the level of business you might already be doing. I know coaches who’ve sold 30 or 40 properties a year with a team of eight people and now they want to educate others on how to build a team. Here’s the thing, though: An eight-man team isn’t profitable only selling 30 to 40 properties a year.

Learn from someone who’s experienced and has actually produced at a high level instead of just read a book—coaching from experience is a lot better than coaching from a book. Also, make sure they’ve produced year after year and they’re not a one-hit wonder. In other words, a coach can average 20 deals a year and then all of a sudden reach 70 deals one year, but only because they bought a bunch of Zillow leads. That’s not the kind of coaching you want to look for.

Second, **choose a coach who’s present all the time**. Think about professional sports teams who practice every day in between their actual games. Their coaches are with them at every practice and on the sidelines during the games. They’re not just watching them on TV. Similarly, you want a coach who’s present all the time instead of someone who’s with you one hour per week and then disappears.

Third, **pick somebody who’s willing to tell you what you don’t want to hear when you don’t want to hear it**. A lot of coaches out there are great cheerleaders, but real growth comes from coaches who hold you accountable and can tell you about things you can do better. Don’t hire a cheerleader. Instead, hire someone who wants to help you develop and wants you to be their next top producer.

I know it’s hard to find coaching that matches these exact criteria, but when you do, that’s when you’ll find other top producers. These agents surround themselves with a coaching environment that’s constant, and if you want to take your business to the next level, you need to align yourself with coaching companies that provide this.

The reality is, you can’t pay for this type of coaching. Just a weekly 30-minute session alone would cost you $1,000. If you find the right company and align yourself with them, though, you’ll receive their coaching as one of their value adds.

I have expert advisors in Charleston and Century 21 Vanguard in Columbia, and we have these kinds of coaching programs in place. We coach agents every day on how to grow their business in a profitable manner, so if you’d like to do the same for your business, don’t hesitate to call or email me so we can get started.

If you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to help you.
