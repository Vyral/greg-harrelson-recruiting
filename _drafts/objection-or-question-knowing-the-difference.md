Sometimes clients ask their agents questions, but the agents hear them as objections. What’s the difference?

If a client or a prospect asks a real estate agent a question, the agent needs to be very careful about interpreting it as an objection. Sometimes it’s a knee-jerk reaction to treat someone’s questions that way, but **when you respond to a question as though it were an objection, all you’ve done is create the objection**.

Here’s an example to help illustrate what I mean:

Suppose that a prospect were to ask you, “Will you cut your commission fee?” That’s a question, but many agents would hear that as an objection and start listing all the reasons why they can’t or shouldn’t cut the commission.

In reality, it really was just a question. Instead of framing it as an objection, try giving some response to the effect of, “You know, I’m sorry, but I can’t do that. Do you have any other questions?” That way, you can give them an honest answer and move on to their other queries. **If the question comes up again, then you can start treating it like an objection**.

Here’s some roleplay to expound upon my example:

**Client** - *“Will you cut your commission fee?”*

**Agent** - &nbsp;*“You know, I’m sorry, but I can’t do that. Do you have any other questions?”*

**Client** - *“Well, another agent told me that they would, and that’s one of the things we’re considering when we compare different agents.”*

With that last response, you now know that it’s an objection, and you may need to dig a little deeper in order to handle the objection and win over the business.

From my experience, I believe that half the time when people ask us these questions, they’re not doing so to raise an objection. By following the methods that I’ve shared today, you won’t have as many objections to handle.

If you have any questions about this or other topics, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you soon.
