In the first of my four-part series, I’ll discuss how to build your business based on buys and sellers alike.

Welcome to the first installment of my four-part series about how to build a listing-based business. Throughout each video, I’ll also discuss how to build a buyer-based business and achieving the perfect balance between buyers and sellers.

I’ll start by using one of my favorite analogies: **Choosing which way to build your business is similar to choosing a flavor at the ice cream shop—there are no “wrong” choices**. Whether you’re building your business based on listings, buyers, or a balance between the two, I intend to show you all available options so you can commit to one path.

After this video, stay tuned for part two of my series. In the meantime, if you have any questions about this topic or there’s anything else I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
