<center><em>Now’s a great time to make contacts for future business.</em></center>

<br>I know we’re going through some crazy times right now, but I’m remaining committed to you and increasing your real estate I.Q. The sharper we are when it comes to knowledge in the field, the better off we will be.

**One thing you can be doing right now to build your business without contact is *making* contacts**. I’m not saying that you need to be out there trying to convince every single prospect to sell or buy, you just need to be in communication with them. You need to communicate with them regularly and focus your conversations on gathering information and collecting details. The most important detail to focus on is their estimated timeframe. From there, you can organize them in your CRM based on their timeline.

Most agents are stopping when somebody says their timeline is far out but you shouldn’t. Let them know you understand why they’re holding off, but you'd still like to know their timeline no matter how far off it is.

**When you know a prospect’s timeframe, you can place them in the proper lead bucket**. They may be in a two-week bucket, a two-month bucket, or even a two-year bucket. Take these buckets and use them to know when to reach out to people. Make those calls, collect the details, put them in the proper bucket, and follow up\! Keep your focus forward and you’ll be grateful for it later.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’d love to help you out.
