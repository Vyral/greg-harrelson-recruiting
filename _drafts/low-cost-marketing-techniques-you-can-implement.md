<center>Marketing is one of the most important parts of selling a home. Here are some inexpensive, effective techniques that we use for our listings.</center>

I’m sure you’ve been in a situation where you’ve talked to a seller client after a few weeks and they want to know what you’ve done to market their home.

A lot of times, **sellers think that all an agent does is take a listing, set it on the MLS, and forget about it**. However, there are plenty of real estate agents out there doing much more, so today I wanted to share some different marketing strategies in place that are low-cost and can be used with all of your listings.

**Here’s an outline of the tips I discussed, with timestamps so that you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most:**
