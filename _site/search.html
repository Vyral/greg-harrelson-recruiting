        "content": "Is your broker providing you the resources you need to grow your business? If not, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to talk to them about it.Â Are you tired of brokers asking you what youâre going to do to grow your business, or bring more listings into the company, or write more contracts?Oftentimes, brokers ask these types of questions not to help you, but to know how you can help them earn their income. In other words, a brokerâs income is really nothing more than a commission they earn for the services they provide to you, while your income is the commission you earn from the services you provide to buyers and sellers.What is your broker doing to earn the money youâre making for them, though? Thatâs an interesting conversation, and Iâm by no means trying to start a feud between you and the company you work for, but I do think that both parties have a responsibility to provide the resources and strategies necessary for each other to grow.Now that the new year has arrived, perhaps itâs time for you to ask yourself whether youâre getting the services and resources you need from the company youâre with. There are three common complaints I hear from agents in search of a better business model:1. There are no leads. Either that or the leads theyâre provided are very low quality and given mostly in order to appease them.2. Thereâs no coaching or training. A lot of top-level professionals in all industries have a coach. Coaching can provide additional strategies you may not have thought of, the resources needed to execute those strategies, accountability, and answers to problems that are keeping your business from growing. Some companies insist that their agents hire their own coaches, but that just means theyâll have to pay another person a portion of their commission for their services, whereas I believe that should be the companyâs responsibility.3. There is too much paperwork. Again, I believe that processing listing paperwork is the companyâs responsibility. I also believe that they should handle some of the marketing for those listings.If you donât think youâre getting the value you need from your company, should you just quit? NoâIâm not saying that at all. All Iâm trying to do is open your eyes to the value you deserve, and sometimes getting that value is as simple as having a conversation with your broker about what you need from them. Give them a chance to provide you with the services and resources you need. If they canât provide these things, itâs up to you whether you want to make a move or not.âYour company should provide you with the CRMs, strategies, and other data you need to generate listings and buyer opportunities.âWith technology so readily available to us, I believe your company should provide you with the CRMs, strategies, and other data you need to generate listings and buyer opportunities. Companies should also provide nurture programs that will allow you to convert data into commission checks.In addition to teaching you how to generate leads, companies should also provide leads themselves. Most agents will never make a good living if they rely specifically on either self-generated leads or company-generated leads, but if you combine these two things, youâll find yourself at the top of your business.Again, Iâm not trying to cause any problems between you and your company, but the next time youâre thinking about what youâre doing for them, ask yourself what theyâre doing for you as well. If you need additional resources, talk to them and see if you can work something out. If you canât, you might want to explore your other options.I coach agents in the Myrtle Beach, Charleston, and Columbia areas, so if youâre in any of these marketplaces, donât hesitate to call or email me. Iâd love to sit down with you and see if I can help you advance your career.If you have any other questions for me or thereâs anything else I can help you with, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to talking to you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "We&rsquo;d love to help you reach your 2019 goals. Here are a few tips that we recommend.Have you ever wondered what it would take for you to start your new year ahead of your goals? Today I have three things you can do to generate momentum quickly and get ahead of your goals to make 2019 your best year yet:1. Call your centers of influence. Everybody says this, but I want to add a twist to it. Your intention for calling these people at the beginning of the year is to identify who may be thinking about completing a real estate transaction sometime in the next calendar year. Ask them what their real estate goals are for this year to get a better idea of where their head is. If you donât ask that question, itâs going to be hard for you to pull out the information yourself. You will find business this way, even on the first day you make 10+ phone calls.2. Communicate with your database. Your database is a bit different than your center of influence. It is a larger group, and itâs important to leverage and monetize this group. Calling everyone in your database will result in you reaching out to a good amount of people that you may never have met in person or only met once. By consistently reaching out to these people throughout the year, you can bring them valuable content and make sure youâre a household name to them. Once you call these people, ask them the same question that you asked your center of influence, and also ask what their goals are for 2019. This method is free, effective, and will help you generate momentum fast.âIf you continue to do the same things, youâll get the same results.â3. Get out of your box. If you continue to do the same things, youâll continue to get the same results. If you want to generate momentum fast and get ahead of your goals, I suggest that you get out of your box. One type of box is your lead generation strategy. If youâre only working with buyers, get out of that box and call those past buyers you have to see if any of them are interested in listing. If your box is cold-calling, get out of that box by calling FSBOs and expireds.In other words, add another lead generation pillar to your business so you can find additional lead sources and give yourself a better chance of doing more business. Maybe getting out of your box has to do with your environment. If you feel like youâre not growing and your career has become stagnant, stop making excuses and change that environment. Find a group that will mentor, guide, and develop you in order to build your business. Iâm not saying you have to change companies, but if youâre not getting what you need to grow your business, itâs time to make a change by using one of these tips above.If you have any questions for me in the meantime about your 2019 goals or about real estate business in general, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What kind of growth or turbulence can we expect from the market in 2019? It may not matter to you if you apply these five steps to your own business.Â The new year is right around the corner, and a pressing question looms over the horizon for our marketâwill 2019 be a boom or bust? The market is buzzing with dialogue concerning this question. While weâve seen continued growth for agents across the board and a healthy market driving these good numbers over the last few years, itâs impossible to ignore whatâs in front of usâis the market going up or down?The prevailing sentiment among the agents I speak to is that there exists an uptick in inventory paired with an increase in days on market for that inventory, at this time. Itâs important to pay attention to the increases in these areas because that signifies a potential softening of the market.Not only that, but agents are also reporting that the flood of multiple offers they were experiencing not that long ago has dried up somewhat.I should note that this isnât to conclusively say that the market is headed in a downward directionâbut the signs are present. Keep in mind that all the chatter weâre hearing around the issue doesnât necessarily equate to a market slowdown.Slowdown or no slowdown, a key question for you to consider is: Will you be prepared if the market does turn down?âItâs important to pay attention to the increases in these areas because that signifies a potential softening of the market.âThough market forces are out of your hands, how you respond to them makes all the difference to your success. Being diligent and adjusting when a market shift is afoot can minimize, or completely preempt, the ill effects that shift has on your businessâand here are five ways in which you can accomplish this:1. Increase lead generation without spending more money. In the event of a market shift, the idea isnât to necessarily discontinue buying leads altogether. Instead, decrease lead flow in high-cost areas so that, in turn, youâll have those extra dollars to increase lead flow in no- or low-cost areas and possibly grow.2. Start communicating with your database. Itâs not just about communicating with your clientsâitâs about doing so with intention. Build foundational rapport with clients now so that if a market shift hits, youâll be the trusted source they call on.3. Surround yourself with agents focused on growing their business. Stay away from the worrywarts or those that get âparalysis through analysis.â Surround yourself with those that are motivated and persist through changing market trends.4. Cut expenses where youâre not tracking a good R.O.I. Take a closer look at your lead sourcesâdispense with those that are not producing a solid R.O.I. Donât ignore this now and risk carrying negative returns into a shifting market.5. Engage in more coaching. Always be involved in the conversation. Keep up on training, coaching, educational outlets, etc. Your growth depends on it.For questions related to this list or advice on other real estate-related questions, Iâd love to sit and talk with you.

On this episode, we talk about the importance of forming a meaningful connection with people, and how it benefits your business.âTo get business, we have to make true and authentic connections with people. -Greg HarrelsonâTakeaways + Tactics  Clients are calling back the people they have the strongest connection with.  The length of time between when you capture a lead and do business with them is a lot longer now, and a real connection will get you through that process.  Donât focus on the length of conversationsâ focus on asking questions.

On this episode, we talk about how agents can prepare themselves for whatâs to come. Â âThe experience we provide needs to not only be a âwowâ experience, but a relevant âwowâ experience.âTakeaways + Tactics  Real estate agents have to learn how to survive when thereâs pressure on commissions.  Right now, itâs better to have a smaller database with high engagement and high connectivity than a large database.  Our primary value to the market isnât negotiationâ itâs marketing and attracting the right types of buyers.In the future, real estate agents might make less money, but this does not mean that the consumer is paying less. It means that the piece of the commission pie might get smaller because itâs being distributed amongst additional players. Weâre progressing to a point where tech companies will have a bigger stake in real estate. There will constantly be new things coming in from technology companies that will make it easier for consumers, agents and tech companies to justify getting a small piece of the transaction.

On this episode, we talk about what it takes to grow your business when the market is up.âFocus on the systems you have in place and make small tweaks. Then let the compound effect be the reason why you gain market share.âTakeaways + Tactics  In a down market the consumer is hiring for skills; But in a hot market theyâre just hiring warm bodies.  There are still plenty of transactions in a down marketâ there are just fewer agents going after them.  Donât reinvent the wheel or focus on shiny objects. Double down on whatâs working already.In a hot market, you get more people with low skill sets flocking to the real estate industry because they think they can make some quick money. In a down market these people leave the business and the skilled agents are in much higher demand. In a hot market, we have more money to buy more shiny objects and open up more circles that we never complete. Those things become distractions that stunt growth. In a down market there are less distractions, and the agents with skill and experience rise to the top, especially when they focus on what works.Learn more about Infusionsoft for real estate:Â http://www.realestatesalessolutions.com/",

If the market continues to rise, sellers are going to slow the pace of houses on the market because they are playing the market for appreciation.
