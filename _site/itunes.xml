Is your broker providing you the resources you need to grow your business? If not, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to talk to them about it.

 

Are you tired of brokers asking you what you’re going to do to grow your business, or bring more listings into the company, or write more contracts?

Oftentimes, brokers ask these types of questions not to help you, but to know how you can help them earn their income. In other words, a broker’s income is really nothing more than a commission they earn for the services they provide to you, while your income is the commission you earn from the services you provide to buyers and sellers.

What is your broker doing to earn the money you’re making for them, though? That’s an interesting conversation, and I’m by no means trying to start a feud between you and the company you work for, but I do think that both parties have a responsibility to provide the resources and strategies necessary for each other to grow.

Now that the new year has arrived, perhaps it’s time for you to ask yourself whether you’re getting the services and resources you need from the company you’re with. There are three common complaints I hear from agents in search of a better business model:

1. There are no leads. Either that or the leads they’re provided are very low quality and given mostly in order to appease them.

2. There’s no coaching or training. A lot of top-level professionals in all industries have a coach. Coaching can provide additional strategies you may not have thought of, the resources needed to execute those strategies, accountability, and answers to problems that are keeping your business from growing. Some companies insist that their agents hire their own coaches, but that just means they’ll have to pay another person a portion of their commission for their services, whereas I believe that should be the company’s responsibility.

3. There is too much paperwork. Again, I believe that processing listing paperwork is the company’s responsibility. I also believe that they should handle some of the marketing for those listings.

If you don’t think you’re getting the value you need from your company, should you just quit? No—I’m not saying that at all. All I’m trying to do is open your eyes to the value you deserve, and sometimes getting that value is as simple as having a conversation with your broker about what you need from them. Give them a chance to provide you with the services and resources you need. If they can’t provide these things, it’s up to you whether you want to make a move or not.

“Your company should provide you with the CRMs, strategies, and other data you need to generate listings and buyer opportunities.”

With technology so readily available to us, I believe your company should provide you with the CRMs, strategies, and other data you need to generate listings and buyer opportunities. Companies should also provide nurture programs that will allow you to convert data into commission checks.

In addition to teaching you how to generate leads, companies should also provide leads themselves. Most agents will never make a good living if they rely specifically on either self-generated leads or company-generated leads, but if you combine these two things, you’ll find yourself at the top of your business.

Again, I’m not trying to cause any problems between you and your company, but the next time you’re thinking about what you’re doing for them, ask yourself what they’re doing for you as well. If you need additional resources, talk to them and see if you can work something out. If you can’t, you might want to explore your other options.

I coach agents in the Myrtle Beach, Charleston, and Columbia areas, so if you’re in any of these marketplaces, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to sit down with you and see if I can help you advance your career.

If you have any other questions for me or there’s anything else I can help you with, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to talking to you.

We&rsquo;d love to help you reach your 2019 goals. Here are a few tips that we recommend.

Have you ever wondered what it would take for you to start your new year ahead of your goals? Today I have three things you can do to generate momentum quickly and get ahead of your goals to make 2019 your best year yet:

1. Call your centers of influence. Everybody says this, but I want to add a twist to it. Your intention for calling these people at the beginning of the year is to identify who may be thinking about completing a real estate transaction sometime in the next calendar year. Ask them what their real estate goals are for this year to get a better idea of where their head is. If you don’t ask that question, it’s going to be hard for you to pull out the information yourself. You will find business this way, even on the first day you make 10+ phone calls.

2. Communicate with your database. Your database is a bit different than your center of influence. It is a larger group, and it’s important to leverage and monetize this group. Calling everyone in your database will result in you reaching out to a good amount of people that you may never have met in person or only met once. By consistently reaching out to these people throughout the year, you can bring them valuable content and make sure you’re a household name to them. Once you call these people, ask them the same question that you asked your center of influence, and also ask what their goals are for 2019. This method is free, effective, and will help you generate momentum fast.

“If you continue to do the same things, you’ll get the same results.”

3. Get out of your box. If you continue to do the same things, you’ll continue to get the same results. If you want to generate momentum fast and get ahead of your goals, I suggest that you get out of your box. One type of box is your lead generation strategy. If you’re only working with buyers, get out of that box and call those past buyers you have to see if any of them are interested in listing. If your box is cold-calling, get out of that box by calling FSBOs and expireds.

In other words, add another lead generation pillar to your business so you can find additional lead sources and give yourself a better chance of doing more business. Maybe getting out of your box has to do with your environment. If you feel like you’re not growing and your career has become stagnant, stop making excuses and change that environment. Find a group that will mentor, guide, and develop you in order to build your business. I’m not saying you have to change companies, but if you’re not getting what you need to grow your business, it’s time to make a change by using one of these tips above.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about your 2019 goals or about real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

What kind of growth or turbulence can we expect from the market in 2019? It may not matter to you if you apply these five steps to your own business.

 

The new year is right around the corner, and a pressing question looms over the horizon for our market—will 2019 be a boom or bust? The market is buzzing with dialogue concerning this question. While we’ve seen continued growth for agents across the board and a healthy market driving these good numbers over the last few years, it’s impossible to ignore what’s in front of us—is the market going up or down?

The prevailing sentiment among the agents I speak to is that there exists an uptick in inventory paired with an increase in days on market for that inventory, at this time. It’s important to pay attention to the increases in these areas because that signifies a potential softening of the market.

Not only that, but agents are also reporting that the flood of multiple offers they were experiencing not that long ago has dried up somewhat.

I should note that this isn’t to conclusively say that the market is headed in a downward direction—but the signs are present. Keep in mind that all the chatter we’re hearing around the issue doesn’t necessarily equate to a market slowdown.

Slowdown or no slowdown, a key question for you to consider is: Will you be prepared if the market does turn down?

“It’s important to pay attention to the increases in these areas because that signifies a potential softening of the market.”

Though market forces are out of your hands, how you respond to them makes all the difference to your success. Being diligent and adjusting when a market shift is afoot can minimize, or completely preempt, the ill effects that shift has on your business—and here are five ways in which you can accomplish this:

1. Increase lead generation without spending more money. In the event of a market shift, the idea isn’t to necessarily discontinue buying leads altogether. Instead, decrease lead flow in high-cost areas so that, in turn, you’ll have those extra dollars to increase lead flow in no- or low-cost areas and possibly grow.

2. Start communicating with your database. It’s not just about communicating with your clients—it’s about doing so with intention. Build foundational rapport with clients now so that if a market shift hits, you’ll be the trusted source they call on.

3. Surround yourself with agents focused on growing their business. Stay away from the worrywarts or those that get “paralysis through analysis.” Surround yourself with those that are motivated and persist through changing market trends.

4. Cut expenses where you’re not tracking a good R.O.I. Take a closer look at your lead sources—dispense with those that are not producing a solid R.O.I. Don’t ignore this now and risk carrying negative returns into a shifting market.

5. Engage in more coaching. Always be involved in the conversation. Keep up on training, coaching, educational outlets, etc. Your growth depends on it.

For questions related to this list or advice on other real estate-related questions, I’d love to sit and talk with you. Give me a call or email me today!

How does Jason Wang overcome challenges and succeed? Let&rsquo;s find out today.

 

Today I speak with one of the newest agents at The Harrelson Group: Jason Wang. Jason, who has been licensed and working with us for only 55 days, has taken on a whopping 22 listings in that short amount of time. This may be unbelievable to some, but thanks to his commitment to the process and mentality surrounding coaching, he was able to reach a level of success many newer agents could not.

        <description>

With all the technology at our disposal, we have never been more disconnected as a society. This is having a real impact on our business as real estate agents. Why are meaningful connections more important than the volume of contacts? What are some ways to deepen the connection with a contact? How can you track your connections and come up with a good metric to measure them? On this episode, we talk about the importance of forming a meaningful connection with people, and how it benefits your business.

“To get business, we have to make true and authentic connections with people. -Greg Harrelson”

Takeaways + Tactics


  Clients are calling back the people they have the strongest connection with.
  The length of time between when you capture a lead and do business with them is a lot longer now, and a real connection will get you through that process.
  Don’t focus on the length of conversations– focus on asking questions.
  Scripts can be very helpful, as they are filled with questions that lead towards genuine connections.

Technology is causing so many great changes that it can be hard to keep up with it all. What can you do to avoid being negatively affected by shifts in the industry? Is there a threat of our commissions being decreased? What changes might technology bring to buyer’s agents, and how do we adapt to an industry moving so quickly? On this episode, we talk about how agents can prepare themselves for what’s to come.  

“The experience we provide needs to not only be a “wow” experience, but a relevant “wow” experience.”

Takeaways + Tactics


  Real estate agents have to learn how to survive when there’s pressure on commissions.
  Right now, it’s better to have a smaller database with high engagement and high connectivity than a large database.
  Our primary value to the market isn’t negotiation– it’s marketing and attracting the right types of buyers.


In the future, real estate agents might make less money, but this does not mean that the consumer is paying less. It means that the piece of the commission pie might get smaller because it’s being distributed amongst additional players. We’re progressing to a point where tech companies will have a bigger stake in real estate. There will constantly be new things coming in from technology companies that will make it easier for consumers, agents and tech companies to justify getting a small piece of the transaction. Agents will have to learn how to thrive when there’s pressure on commissions.

In a hot market, skilled agents find themselves competing with less skilled agents for clients who may not be able to see the difference right away. How do you prove yourself when the consumer isn’t really looking for skill? Why is a down market actually a lot easier to grow in? How do you go about growing your market share when so many people want a piece of the pie? On this episode, we talk about what it takes to grow your business when the market is up.

“Focus on the systems you have in place and make small tweaks. Then let the compound effect be the reason why you gain market share.”

Takeaways + Tactics


  In a down market the consumer is hiring for skills; But in a hot market they’re just hiring warm bodies.
  There are still plenty of transactions in a down market– there are just fewer agents going after them.
  Don’t reinvent the wheel or focus on shiny objects. Double down on what’s working already.


In a hot market, you get more people with low skill sets flocking to the real estate industry because they think they can make some quick money. In a down market these people leave the business and the skilled agents are in much higher demand. In a hot market, we have more money to buy more shiny objects and open up more circles that we never complete. Those things become distractions that stunt growth. In a down market there are less distractions, and the agents with skill and experience rise to the top, especially when they focus on what works.

We’re all leaders because we lead ourselves. Why do you have to be a good self-leader before you’re qualified to lead others effectively? What makes someone a great leader? On this mini-episode, we talk about how to be a better leader, and the secret so few people know about leadership.

“You must be the example for other people to follow.”

Takeaways + Tactics


  You have to be an effective self-leader before you lead others because it gives you credibility.
  If you’re having trouble leading others, you have problems with self-leadership.
  You must be the example for other people to follow.  


A lot of people have a hard time attracting loyal followers because they weren’t followers themselves in the first place. They don’t lead themselves, and that makes it impossible for them to lead others. The truth about leadership is you become better by becoming a great learner, and a great player who follows a great coach. It all starts with you, so ask yourself if you’re a great follower of the things that you say and if you have integrity with the things you tell people do.

This is the time of the year where we evaluate the market for potential risks, and a huge one right now is the risk for low inventory. Why is it so important to plan ahead for these events? How do you fortify yourself from the eventual reduction in inventory? On this episode, we talk about the importance of being ready for potential market risks.

“When I’m already solving a problem that doesn’t yet exist, the problem never appears.”

Takeaways + Tactics


  There’s a lot of quick, easy money on the buyer’s side right now, so people don’t think they need listings.
  If the market continues to rise, sellers are going to slow the pace of houses on the market because they are playing the market for appreciation.
  The two most effective ways to generate leads in a low-inventory environment are expireds and FSBOs.


The goal in business is to always start working a plan as if an upcoming obstacle is there now. You have to set up the systems right now to combat the risks when they do appear. Just because there’s a lot of buying happening right now, don’t fall into the trap of not building up your listings. If inventory to sell runs out, you’re in a better position if you’ve been cultivating listings. Right now, you have a good story to tell sellers in prospecting which is that prices are increasing and inventory is low, so their house could be worth more. That’s a winning script.

Developing talent is an important part of going from agent to entrepreneur. How do you connect with your talent on a level that actually resonates with them and their needs? What are the three things we track to make sure what we’re doing is actually working? How do you check in and stay in contact? On this mini-episode, we talk about developing talent, helping people grow and building top producers from scratch.

“Tracking our numbers is going to tell us how we’re doing with our lead generation activities and the conversations we’re having.”

Takeaways + Tactics


  If you can leverage a person’s strengths, you can get to revenue more easily.
  You’ll be able to leverage their strengths faster than you can strengthen their weaknesses.  
  Every transaction is going to come from a conversation.


Most people’s first instinct when it comes to developing talent is to try and get people emotionally invested and fired up by the possibilities they see for that person. What you should actually do first is connect with them on what’s important to them. Honor them by showing that you actually want to know them. When you get into their world you will understand them better. When you do that, their mindset changes, they gain confidence and they become more coachable. This will get you to more income, faster.

        <description>

People are looking for a method of lead generation and prospecting that feels comfortable to them. However, this comfort is dictated by bias—not reality. How do you get inspired to make a breakthrough in your resistance to prospecting? Why do people struggle to say they are salespeople? How do you use contribution to get over the monetary motivation? On this episode, we discuss the real reason people resist prospecting and how to overcome it.

“I got over a resistance to prospecting when I changed my perspective.”

Takeaways + Tactics


  Contribution goals can be more effective than monetary goals.
  People don’t want to say they are a great salesperson because they associate sales with something bad.
  Change your goal from “how much money you want to make” to how many families you want to help and that will make the job about contribution.


At the start of the show, we talked about why people are always looking for a lead generation method that feels comfortable. Next, we talked about the power of shifting your mindset if you want to get better at lead generation. We also talked about why people don’t want to be associated with being good at sales.

We also discussed:


  How to change your goals from money to contribution
  How to change your perspectives of prospecting activities


It is impossible to successfully overcome hesitation towards prospecting and lead generation without a mindset shift. For most people, the resistance comes from wanting to be comfortable and not wanting to face the limiting beliefs they have about selling. When you change your goals from “make money” to “make a contribution”, you will overcome the fear of being good at selling. When you change your perception of that activity, your comfort level will greatly increase.

        <title>Distractions, Momentum & Opportunity: How To Clean Up in a Distracted Market</title>
        <link>MyrtleBeachRealEstateMastermind.com/distractions-momentum-opportunity-how-to-clean-up-in-a-distracted-market.html</link>

        <description>

With everything happening in the world right now, the consumer is more distracted than ever. How can this cause a shift in momentum in the market? How do you offset the potential losses? How do you bring attention back to what’s important and have the right conversations with your clients? On this episode, we discuss how to maintain momentum, even when people are focused on everything that’s happening in the world.

“When the distraction of the consumer increases, the answer for the agent is to actually decrease distraction and increase their number of contacts.”

Takeaways + Tactics


  There are distractions you can control and distractions you cannot control.
  Right now, the market is so good that it’s even rewarding people who aren’t skilled or efficient.
  Media companies monetize distraction.
  Don’t communicate about the transaction, communicate the motivation.


At the start of the show, we discussed the various things that are distracting the consumer, and what it has to do with the news. Next, we discussed what would go wrong if the both the consumer and the agent are distracted. We also talked about the power of showing people that you really care, and that you want what is best for them. Towards the end of the show, we talked about how people attract business by treating people like they are already your clients.

We also discussed:


  How to get better at asking good questions and listening
  How to increase your activity when the market slows down
  How distraction creates inactivity


Distractions give people a sense of uncertainty. When people feel uncertain, they tend not to make a lot of decisions. If the consumer’s distraction and inaction is coupled with the agent’s inactivity, this can have a huge impact on the market. As an agent, it is your job to limit distractions by having better conversations. In the face of a distractions, keep your client focused on their motivation. Remember: people’s motivation isn’t “to sell a house”, but to acquire the benefits that come along as a result of the sale. If you want to succeed in this distraction-laden market, decrease distraction in your interactions and increase your number of contacts.

Many real estate agents prospect for appointments but end up fearing the appointment itself. Why is that? How can we overcome our fear of rejection and make it work for us? Can building a boring day-to-day life really make us successful? In this episode, we reframe rejection and boredom as the key to success.

“If you will go ahead and master the listing presentation first, then you’re excited to make the call”

Takeaways + Tactics


  Agents gravitate toward buyers to avoid rejection and limit their personal growth and their business all at the same time.
  Even when you lose a listing, sellers aren’t rejecting you, they are rejecting your WORDS - something you said during the listing consultation.
  Boredom is about YOU. Change your focus to the people you are serving and you won’t feel boredom.

First we talked about building a career out of prospecting and the newfound prospecting generation with real estate agents. We also discussed the benefits of prospecting and its sticking points. Next, we talked about why some people subconsciously avoid prospecting and getting a listing appointment. We agreed that by mastering the listing presentation, then you’ll be less hesitant to get on the phone and get that appointment. We also mentioned how empathy and creating a prospecting ritual can not only benefit the client but also the agent themselves. Finally, we mentioned how appreciation for that style of work grows over time as you get more and more committed to your prospecting ritual.

On this episode we also discussed:


  How failure to follow up can lead to losses
  Overcoming the fear of rejection
  The importance of consistency
  Sustainable boredom and its benefits
  Minimizing distractions through rituals
  and much more


It’s critical to be consistent and persistent at the same time. Rejection is something we will all have to face at some point - so it’s important to reconsider the way we think about being rejected and focus on how to avoid that rejection for the next listing.

And when we talk about consistency, most of the time, boredom has to be a part of the conversation as well. Being boring is now a sustainable choice and a sensible solution for a business. It’s all about installing some variety in your boring day-to-day activities. Mastering that balance and shifting your perspective on rejection and boredom can be a solid way to get more listings and build a successful real estate business.
